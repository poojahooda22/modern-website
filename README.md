Creating a portfolio website with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and incorporating animations using GSAP for an animated button, involves several key steps. First, structure your website with HTML, defining sections like "About Me," "Projects," "Skills," and "Contact". Then, style your website using CSS for a visually appealing layout, paying attention to responsive design for various device sizes. Implement interactive elements with vanilla JavaScript, such as dynamic content loading or form handling. For the animated button, use GSAP to create engaging hover and click effects, enhancing the user experience. Finally, ensure cross-browser compatibility and optimize for performance and accessibility.
